The pitch of the flapping-wing ornithopter (MetaFly) is save in a rosbag (with many other information such as position). 
The Vicon Motion Capture is used to track the ornithopter in the arena.
The flapping-wing frequency is deducted from the intra-flapping body pitch.

- The trajectory of the ornithopter is a circle with a raduis of 1.75m. The flight is mantained at a desired altitude (0.7m in the test).
